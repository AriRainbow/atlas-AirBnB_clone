## Project Description
This project is the first step in creating a clone of the AirBnB web
application. It includes a command interpreter to manage the objects of the
application, such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving date. Future
versions of the project will include a web interface, a database, and 
additional functionalities to mimic the real AirBnb service.
